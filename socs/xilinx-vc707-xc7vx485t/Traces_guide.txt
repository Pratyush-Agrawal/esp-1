In order to get the simulation traces for a functional test, the following steps 
should be followed:


              ## Generate the simulation List in normal test mode ##

The content of the file esp/socs/xilinx-vc707-xc7vx485t/gettrace.tcl must be used
to create the simulation list with the correct format that can be modified by the listotxt.c scrpit

At this point, after modifying the content of the bootrom according to the type of
test that needs to be executed and running the simulation, the list can be exported 
(File>Export>Tabular List) and saved to the folder esp/socs/xilinx-vc707-xc7vx485t 
with the name list.lst .

                  ## Obtain the traces from the simulation list ##

The list can now be turned into the 6 simulation traces ( one for each NoC plane) 
by running the script listotxt.c with the following commands from the deisgn folder:

gcc listotxt.c -lm -o listotxt.bin 
./listotxt.bin 

As a result, 6 stimulus files named as "stim(#NoC_plane).txt" will be generated in the deisgn 
folder and directly used from the testbench in test mode.

Finally, in order to run the simulation in test mode, using the generated stimulus files, 
the testbench must be modified by disenabling the comment for the tms bit activation. 
(Some meaningful signals that could be added to the simulation waveforms in test mode are
indicated in the file esp/socs/xilinx-vc707-xc7vx485t/addwave.tcl)
